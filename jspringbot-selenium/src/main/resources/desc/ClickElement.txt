Click element identified by locator.

If you want to click the element at certain coordinates, you can specify the position with coordinates argument in format x,y. Support for coordinates was added in SeleniumLibrary 2.7.

Examples:
| Click Element | my_id | |
| Click Element | my_id | and don't wait | |
| Click Element | my_id | 100,150        | |
| Click Element | my_id | coordinates=100,150 | # Use named argument syntax available in RF 2.5 and newer |
